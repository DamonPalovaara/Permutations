First you must install Rust, follow the instructions here:

https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

Next download this repository somewhere. If you have issues with that I'd recommened reaching out to one of the CS professors or me.

Once downloaded you can right click inside of the folder and select "open up in terminal".

Now all you need to do is execute the command ```cargo run```
